# Food Recognition Model

### Overview

This project involves building an end-to-end CNN Image Classification Model that can accurately identify different food items from images.

By leveraging a pre-trained model available in Keras, I fine-tuned it using the widely known Food101 dataset, enhancing its performance for food classification.

Interesting Fact

The model outperforms the accuracy achieved in the DeepFood research paper, which was trained on the same dataset.

DeepFood Model Accuracy: 77.4%

Our Model Accuracy: 85%

The most impressive part? While the DeepFood model required 2-3 days for training, this model achieved higher accuracy in just 90 minutes!

Key Model Details

Dataset Used: Food101

Model Architecture: EfficientNetV2B0

Final Accuracy: 85%

Project Workflow: How was it built?

If you're interested in the technical process behind the model's training, refer to the model-training.ipynb Notebook.

Key Steps:

Dataset Acquisition

Imported the Food101 dataset from TensorFlow Datasets.

Data Exploration & Visualization

Conducted thorough data analysis and visualization to understand dataset characteristics.

Optimizing Performance with Mixed Precision Training

Configured the dtype policy to mixed_float16 for improved efficiency.

Mixed precision combines 16-bit and 32-bit floating-point operations to enhance speed and reduce memory usage.

Model Training & Callbacks Implementation

Utilized EfficientNetV2B0 as the base model for fine-tuning.

Implemented essential callbacks:

TensorBoard for visualization.

EarlyStopping to halt training when improvements plateau.

ReduceLROnPlateau to adjust the learning rate dynamically.

Fine-Tuning the Model

Fine-tuned the model on Food101 for optimized performance.

Experimented with hyperparameters to maximize accuracy.

Model Evaluation

Evaluated the model on unseen data to ensure generalization.

Tested predictions on real-world food images to validate model performance.
